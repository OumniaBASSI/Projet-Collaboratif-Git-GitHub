## Why GitHub is Important

GitHub is not just a code hosting platform — it’s a vital tool for every developer or development team. Here’s why:

- **Easier collaboration**: GitHub allows multiple developers to work on the same project while keeping a clear history of who did what and when.
- **Version control**: With Git (the version control system), you can revert to previous versions of your code, compare changes, and track project evolution.
- **Teamwork with branches**: GitHub makes it easy to create branches to test new features without affecting the main code (`main` or `master`).
- **Code review and pull requests**: Developers can submit their changes through pull requests, allowing teammates to review and approve code before merging.
- **Project portfolio**: A well-organized GitHub profile serves as a professional portfolio. Recruiters, clients, or collaborators can see your skills through public projects.
- **Automation (CI/CD)**: GitHub integrates with tools to automate testing, deployment, and more.
- **Open source community**: GitHub is at the heart of modern open source. Contributing to existing projects helps you learn, gain visibility, and be part of a global tech community.
