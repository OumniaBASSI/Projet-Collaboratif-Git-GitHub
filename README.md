## ðŸ‘¤ Roles in a Project Team (by Bob)


In an effective project team, each member plays a key role. Here's a typical breakdown of roles:

- **Project Manager**: Coordinates the team, plans milestones, and ensures the project progresses on schedule.
- **Scrum Master**: Oversees branches, resolves conflicts, and manages pull requests.
- **Developer**: Writes documents (README, CONTRIBUTING, etc.) and ensures content clarity.
- **Observer/Tester**: Reviews contributions, provides feedback, suggests improvements, and ensures overall consistency.

These roles can rotate to allow everyone to develop new skills.
